# MalhotraKumarMaheshwari-and-Preflow-push-algorithms
There are programm which has two classes (MalhotraKumarMaheshwari and Preflow) realized two algorithms of MaxFlow find (Malhotra-Kumar-Maheshwari algorithm and push–relabel algorithm (alternatively, preflow–push algorithm) V^3

Class Network and function ReadNetwork which is special for same task, are in programm too.

Both MalhotraKumarMaheshwari and Preflow classes take Network and have public functions findMaxFlow, which returns MaxFlow of this Network.
