# MalhotraKumarMaheshwari-and-Preflow-push-algorithms
There are programm which has two classes (MalhotraKumarMaheshwari and Preflow) realized two algorithms for finding Maximum Flows in Networks (Malhotra-Kumar-Maheshwari algorithm and push–relabel algorithm (alternatively, preflow–push algorithm). Both algorithms have ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O%28V%5E3%29) time complexity

Class Network, which  and function, ReadNetwork which is special for same task, are in programm too.

Both MalhotraKumarMaheshwari and Preflow classes have public functions findMaxFlow, which takes Network and returns Maximum Flow of this Network.
